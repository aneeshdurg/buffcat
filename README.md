# BuffCat

A heavy-duty file concatenation tool. It's `cat` on steroids.

BuffCat aims to be a fast tool for building files as concatenations of other files.

BuffCat overcomes limitations of `cat`, by providing faster output generation, features to specify
that files should be written multiple times, and with no limits on the number of input files.
